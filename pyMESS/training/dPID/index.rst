   Write an (discrete) PID-controller, for fun and exercise.

.. update:: 2023/10/01

   Updated the dPID exercise, with Python Type Hints. And Use it more generic.
   Although it still an python exercise, one can also implemented it in f.e. C++


A basic :class:`class definition <dpid.dPID>` is given; which has to be tested and implemented. By starting
with the *test-part*, which is advisable anyhow (the TDD approach), the exercise starts simple.

A few :ref:`test-examples <dPID_test_examples>` are also given. This file can be used as *'template'* to
write your own tests.
